Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI) are both used to read, write, and find files in folders. GUI makes it easy for the everyday user to access their files by adding a user interface. This allows people to simply click between their files and folders to do simple tasks like open them, copy and paste, delete them, etc. While it may limit control of what a user can do, the purpose of it was to make it so that anyone, even with little to none computer knowledge, can access their files without needing to memorize any commands. CLI on the other hand removes the friendly user interface but allows for a lot more control when it comes to accessing files. Rather than having buttons to click and find your files, CLI uses commands and abbreviations to navigate files. With a lot more commands this allows users a lot more control. For the more experienced user CLI can be a helpful tool and allow for a lot more complex tasks, however it makes it more intimidating for the everyday user. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages but in the end it comes done to both experience and user preference when it comes to choosing between GUI and CLI
