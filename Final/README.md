For my final project I want to recreate Space Invaders in p5.min.
Essentaly you will be a space ship with the abilty to move left or right, and fire a lazer up. As aliens fall from the top of the screen you must avoid them as they shoot at you.

This seems like a completely do-able thing to do do in p5.min after seeing examples of what people have done with p5.min.Ryan Stipes, Final Night helped prove somthing like this would be possible. showning it possible for the character to move, attack, and have health.

the problems I can think of is finding a way to make it so the aliens move from one side to the other BEFORE they move down, essentally they need to move from one side of the screen to the other, then move down and repeate
Also I will need to learn how colitions will work in p5.min because we did not cover that in the assignments.
Finally I want to see how create sprites in p5.min so I dont have to create the enemys by drawing them.

I will start this project as soon as I submit this proposal and will work on it durring any free time I have inbetween classes and work to ensure its done before the deadline
