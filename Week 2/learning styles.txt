I sincerely believe that an individual's learning styles have a massive effect on how they learn. If a teaching style does not work well with a student's learning style, they will not learn as well. During high school I had to take multiple different types of math class, but there were only two math teachers. One of the teachers taught their class by reading word for word out of a math textbook, while the other would draw the lesson and explain in detail how it worked and have us solve problems he made on the fly. I learned a lot more from the teacher that drew because that was my learning style. Being engaged and actively participating helped me learn more than just reading from a textbook. The point im say is that everyone has a different learning style and it can be the difference between learning a subject and not learning it
