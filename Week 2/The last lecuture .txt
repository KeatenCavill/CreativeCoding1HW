Around the 1:01:46 mark of the lecture, Randy said “I don't know how to have fun. I'm dying and I'm having fun, and I will keep having fun every day I have left…” That is the line that probably affects me the most and is what I identify with. When it comes to decision making for me, about 80% of it is me asking, “will it be fun” and that usually ends up being the deciding factor when it applies. I think that having fun is the most important ability humans have, because anyone can do it, anytime, anywhere. It’s what forms us and how we act everyday. Your most important memories were probably a time when you were having fun. Even for someone like Randy, after getting diagnosed with cancer and being told he has months left to live, he still is having fun.That is how I would want my final months to be. I don't want people to feel sad about my death, I want them to remember me in my best moments with good memories, who doesn't want that? In the end, having fun is the best part of life. Something everyone has the ability to do and it is what makes life interesting. Randy said it best by saying it's like fish without water.
